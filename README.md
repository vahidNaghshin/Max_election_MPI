# Max_election_MPI
This is the Python-based MPI implementation of the leader election algorithm. For a given number of nodes, each node generate 64-bit random integer initially. Using message passing interface (MPI) protocol, nodes exchange messages with limited number of neighbours to reach a consensus on maximum value among nodes' value.
